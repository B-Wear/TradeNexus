# TradeNexus Algorithmic Trading System

This project implements an algorithmic trading system named TradeNexus, featuring technical analysis, pattern recognition, risk management, and backtesting capabilities.

## Overview

The TradeNexus system is structured into the following modules:

* **`config/config.json`**: Configuration file for managing various parameters of the TradeNexus system. This includes settings for risk per trade, maximum open positions, indicator configurations, and risk management rules.
* **`trading_strategy.py`**: Contains the `TradingStrategy` class, which is responsible for calculating technical indicators using the `TA-Lib` library and detecting both candlestick and chart patterns. It also generates trading signals based on a comprehensive analysis of these factors, taking market regimes into account.
* **`risk_management.py`**: Defines the `Trade` class to structure information about individual trades and the `RiskManager` class to handle critical risk management functions such as stop-loss and take-profit calculations, as well as trailing stop logic.
* **`trading_system.py`**: The core of the TradeNexus system. The `TradingSystem` class manages capital, active trades, trade history, risk metrics, and orchestrates the interaction between the `TradingStrategy` and `RiskManager`. It also includes functionalities for monitoring performance, strategy recalibration, and saving/loading the system's state.
* **`backtest.py`**: Provides a backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of the TradeNexus trading strategy using historical data. It simulates trading with options for including slippage and commission and outputs detailed performance metrics along with a visual equity curve.
* **`README.md`**: This file provides a comprehensive overview of the TradeNexus project and detailed instructions for setup and usage.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you have the code in a repository).
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy ta-lib matplotlib
    ```
    **Note:** Installing `ta-lib` might require specific steps based on your operating system. Please refer to the [TA-Lib documentation](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/) for detailed installation instructions.
3.  **Configure TradeNexus:**
    * Carefully review and modify the `config/config.json` file to adjust the trading parameters to align with your preferences and the specific strategy you intend to use.
4.  **Prepare historical data:**
    * For backtesting the TradeNexus strategy, you will need to provide historical price data in a Pandas DataFrame format. This DataFrame should include the following columns: `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `volume`. The index of the DataFrame must consist of datetime objects representing the timestamps of the data.
    * Update the `backtest.py` script to correctly load your prepared historical data.

## Usage

### Backtesting TradeNexus

1.  Ensure that you have correctly prepared your historical data and have updated the `backtest.py` script to load it.
2.  Run the backtesting script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python backtest.py
    ```
3.  The script will output a summary of the backtesting performance metrics in the console. Additionally, it will display an equity curve plot, visually representing the cumulative performance of the TradeNexus strategy over the historical period you tested.

### Running TradeNexus for Live Trading (Conceptual - Requires Brokerage API Integration)

To deploy the TradeNexus system for live or paper trading, the following steps would be necessary:

1.  **Integrate with a Brokerage API:** You would need to integrate the `TradingSystem` class with the API of your chosen brokerage. Libraries such as `ccxt` can be helpful for this purpose. This integration would involve writing code to fetch real-time market data and to execute trading orders on the exchange.
2.  **Implement a Data Feed:** Modify the system to continuously fetch live market data and feed it into the `trading_system.process_market_data()` method.
3.  **Implement Order Execution:** Develop the logic within the `TradingSystem` to translate the generated trading signals into actual buy and sell orders that are sent to the brokerage API for execution.

**Important Note:** The current version of TradeNexus primarily focuses on the core trading logic and backtesting capabilities. Integrating with a live brokerage API is an advanced task that requires a thorough understanding of the API documentation, secure handling of API keys, robust error handling, and careful management of trading risks.

## Disclaimer

The TradeNexus algorithmic trading system is provided for educational and informational purposes only. Trading in financial markets carries substantial risk, and it is possible to lose your entire investment. The results obtained from backtesting are not necessarily indicative of future performance in live trading conditions. Use this software at your own risk. It is strongly recommended to conduct thorough testing and fully understand the risks involved before deploying any trading strategy, including TradeNexus, in a live trading environment.
